Version 3.1.5 (2011-03-01)
 * display time it took and number of hosts scanned

Version 3.1.4.1 (2011-02-05)
 * add autopw password injector

Version 3.1.4 (2011-01-29)
 * aggregator scripts should be passed date the scan was
   started
 * don't use possibly PREFIX variable in the generic aggregator -- it is
   set in the scanmaster already

Version 3.1.3 (2011-01-28)
 * remove hardcoded references users, keys, hostnames,
   pathnames etc.

Version 3.1.2 (2011-01-22)
 * ensure all output is collected in aggregator

Version 3.1.1 (2011-01-19)
 * let the aggregator also collect hosts_exit_* files

Version 3.1.0 (2010-12-11)
 * allow use to specify password-only, pubkey-only or
   either-or via -A authmode; allow user to set SSHOPTS in environment
 * allow user to set SSH_ADD_OPTS to influence ssh-add(1) behaviour
 * allow user to set SCAN_ENV to influence all scanslave(1) processes

Version 3.0.0 (2010-11-23)
 * use a headless user by default

Version 2.3.3 (2010-08-23)
 * add generic wrapper scripts

Version 2.3.2 (2010-08-12)
 * if input has too few lines, don't try to split

Version 2.3.1 (2010-08-04)
 * invoke tkill every minute; otherwise a hung job will be terminated only
   after 10 minutes (worst case)
 * try to kill a possibly running ssh-agent when all is said and done
 * tkill all processes running for longer than 120 seconds

Version 2.3.0 (2010-07-21)
 * let scanslave start an ssh-agent;
   change protocol order to 2,1: not all hosts have an sshv1 key, so
   attempting sshv1 first with a key and failing will end the attempts
 * explicitly disable agent forwarding when connecting to the target hosts

Version 2.2.2 (2009-11-07)
 * remove slave status file after it finished

Version 2.2.1 (2009-11-07)
 * fix syntax error introduced in 2.2

Version 2.2 (2009-11-07)
 * add suggestion for a wrapper if aggregator args aren't
   sufficiently flexible
 * offer a way to show what slaves are still working (done
   by way of SIGINFO)
 * correct use of ssh agent forwarding

Version 2.1 (2009-09-14)
 * explicitly set StrictHostKeyChecking=no
 * don't interpret '*' as a filename if not enough hosts
   are given on input to actually create a split
 * don't require optional files/arguments
 * clarify that a number of scripts passed to scanmaster
   are passed through to all scanslaves

Version 2.0 (2009-08-02)
 * use , as OFS

Version 1.1 (2009-08-02)
 * make remote exit codes useful
 * add examples to scanslave and scanmaster manpages
 * let scanmaster pass additional flags to scanslave

Version 1.0 (2009-05-18)
 * run the pre-script before checking for existence of other given files,
   since the pre-script might generate some of them
 * don't invoke an ssh-agent; if users want to use an
   agent, they need to start it on their desktop and forward it
   (change in behaviour, so bumping major)

Version 0.1 (2009-05-07)
 * Initial packaged version
