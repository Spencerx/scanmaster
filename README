sshscan is a set of scripts that allow you to ssh to a very large
number of hosts in parallel to run an arbitrary script on the remote side.
It works best if the scans can take advantage of a set of scanslave nodes
with access to shared NFS space, though that is not a hard requirement.

sshscan was initially written January 2007 by Jan Schaumann while
working at Yahoo! Inc. Yahoo! open sourced the tool in the hopes that it
will be useful to other people -- unless otherwise noted, all files are
released under the terms of a 3-clause BSD license as noted in the file
LICENSE.
